        <h3>Information about our QR CodeMaker</h3>
        <p>You can generate free QR codes on this website. A QR code is a two dimensional barcode that stores
            information in black and white dots (called data pixels or “QR code modules”). Besides the black and white
            version, you can also create a colored QR code. For these codes to work without problems, make sure the
            contrast is sufficient and the result is not a negative (in terms of color). To make your QR code even
            better, you can also get a QR code with logo.<br>
            We use the service (API) of <a href="https://goqr.me/api/"> QR code generator</a> in our Website.


        </p>

        <h3>Create a QR code</h3>
        <p>Just enter your text, your URL, a SMS or vCard contact information. The QR code will be generated
            automatically as you type. Just click on the “Download” button to get the created QR code image then (the
            image is available as EPS or SVG vector graphic, as well as high-resolution PNG, GIF or JPEG raster graphics
            format). You can also embed the QR code directly on your own website and use it, just have a look at the
            code offered by the “Embed” button. Of course, you can place and use the QR graphic on leaflets, posters,
            business cards or other products without any costs / for free (including commercial use).</p>
        <p>QR codes are the way to go to create a link between the real world products (tagged with the QR code) and the
            Internet. Mobile, anywhere, anytime. Because QR codes make it so easy to transfer a web link to a mobile
            phone, they provide a significantly lower barrier to visit a site with a smart phone. But you can also work
            with other texts and data, such as advertising messages, telephone numbers and even entire business cards in
            vCard format. Just encode them with our QR code generator to easily transfer the data to mobile devices.</p>

        <h3>QR code software</h3>
        <p>There are many QR code software products on the market (to create, read, manage or design a QR code, and so
            on). Therefore we created a small overview of the most important products.</p>
